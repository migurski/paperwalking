    Why do scans fail? Based on the errors we’ve seen, scans seem to fail for one of three reasons:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Many users have been uploading the same print PDF’s downloaded from this site. Scans need to be bitmap images, ideally JPEG’s.</li>
    <li>Some users have submitted scans that are at a low resolution, or low-quality photographs instead of scans. Check the print pages for an address where you can mail us paper to have scanned!</li>
    <li>Some scans have come out of printers with failing ink cartridges, which makes important details such as the QR code in the lower-right corner illegible.</li>
</ol>
