    <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> is a wiki-style map
    of the world that anyone can edit. In some places, participants are
    creating the first freely-available maps by GPS survey. In other places,
    such as the United States, basic roads exist, but lack local detail:
    locations of traffic signals, ATMs, caf√©s, schools, parks, and shops.
    What such partially-mapped places need is not more GPS traces, but
    additional knowledge about what exists on and around the street. Walking
    Papers is made to help you easily create printed maps, mark them with
    things you know, and then share that knowledge with OpenStreetMap.

    <strong>To get started</strong>, search for a town or city you know, then pan and zoom the map to an exact location.
