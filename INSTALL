Installing Paperwalking on Ubuntu 9
-----------------------------------

Hardware
--------

I've tested this guide on two platforms: Amazon's EC2 cloud-based computing
service, and the SheevaPlug, a miniaturized ARM-based plug computing platform.
SheevaPlug comes with Ubuntu 9.04, while EC2 can run Ubuntu 9.10 machine images.
Machine images from Alestic.com seem to work well, and the guide below was
produced using ami-19a34270 (alestic/ubuntu-9.10-karmic-base-20090623).

When setting up an EC2 instance, make sure it's in a security group that can
accept both SSH and HTTP connections!

Start by logging into the server via SSH, as the root user.

Software
--------

There are a few packages that you will need to install: some base material,
packaged for use by the offline image decoder, and packages to help run the
public-facing website. During the last step below, you'll be asked to create
a root MySQL password a few times, it's fine to leave this blank.

% apt-get update
% apt-get install curl vim screen tcsh sudo build-essential git-core
% apt-get intsall python-imaging python-numpy openjdk-6-jre-headless
% apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-gd php5-mysql mysql-server-5.1 php-pear

Paperwalking uses server packages from PHP's PEAR collection. The can be
installed via the pear utility. Some of the packages below will throw warnings
about deprecation, don't worry about those.

% pear install Crypt_HMAC HTTP_Request DB
% pear install Crypt_HMAC2 MDB2 MDB2#mysql

Apache's default configuration will need to be edited slightly. Edit the line
with "DocumentRoot" to say: DocumentRoot /var/www/paperwalking/site/www, then
restart Apache.

% pico /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
% apache2ctl restart

Try http://example.host in a browser.

Now, to install Paperwalking itself.

% cd /var/www
% git clone http://github.com/migurski/paperwalking.git paperwalking
% cd paperwalking
% git submodule init && git submodule update

% mysql -u root
	> create database paperwalking character set='utf8';
	> grant select, insert, update, delete, lock tables on paperwalking.* to paperwalking@localhost identified by 'w4lks';
	> flush privileges;
	> quit;

% mysql -u root paperwalking < site/doc/create.mysql
% cd site && make

The main site configuration information is kept in lib/init.php. Paperwalking
comes with a blank that you have to copy and edit with your favorite text editor.

% cp lib/init.php.txt lib/init.php
% pico lib/init.php

Change these two lines (choose your own password):
1.	define('DB_DSN', 'mysql://paperwalking:w4lks@localhost/paperwalking');
2.	define('API_PASSWORD', 'swordfish');

Now try http://example.host in a browser to see it work. Make a new print, it
might take a little while (we'll get back to this later). Print it, scan it, or
just convert it to a JPEG, and post the image back to your instance of Paperwalking.
Note that it's just sitting there, "queued for processing". Keep this browser
window open, because we need to build SIFT.

% cd ../decoder
% make

Some stuff will scroll by, you may see compiler warnings, ignore these unless
actual errors show up. Run the decoder once with the password chosen above.

% python poll.py -p swordfish -b http://localhost once

Watch the scan page in your browser update as it progresses through the image.

If it works, then re-run poll.py without the "once" argument at the end.

We don't have a proper daemon wrapper for this yet, so I've just been running it
in screen as a cheap way to get a long-running process going. It sounds ghetto,
but I've had processes like this one stay up for months at a time this way.

Use of screen to maintain long-running shell sessions is described here:

Now for a few optional niceties.

First, we can speed up the creation of print maps by using Modest Maps ws-compose.

% cd ~
% git clone http://github.com/migurski/modestmaps-py.git modestmaps

And in a screen as above:

% cd modestmaps
% python ws-compose.py

Back in the site configuration, configure ws-compose.

% pico /var/www/paperwalking/site/lib/init.php 
	define('WSCOMPOSE_HOSTPORTS', '127.0.0.1:9999');

Finally we can get applications IDs for three external information services,
for specific improvements to the site.

GeoPlanet is used in conjunction with the "Find" button on the map composition page:

Flickr does our reverse-geocoding, so that maps of arbitrary places can be given names:

Cloudmade provides a few extra map styles:
