<h2>You’re Uploading A Scanned Map</h2>

<p>
    You’re here because you have a paper version of a
    <a href="{$base_dir}/prints.php">printed map</a> and you’d like to
    send a scanned version to trace into OpenStreetMap.
    Your scan should be a reasonably-high resolution
    (200+ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dpi</a>)
    image file, such as a JPEG. A PDF file will not work.
